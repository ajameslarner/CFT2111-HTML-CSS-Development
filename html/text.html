            <p>The construction of Caminito del Rey began in 1901 and lasted four years, it was used by maintenance workers from Saltos del Gaitanejo and El Chorro. The name of <b>King's Path</b> was given after the visit of King Alfonso XIII who used this walkway to inaugurate the dam Conde del Guadalhorce.</p>
            <p>The original builders were sailors hanging from the cliff, they built a very primitive walkway made of wood planks in a quite insecure way, they were used to make some similar works hanging from their sailing boats.</p>
            <p>Between 1940 and 1950 it was an habitual transit walkway among residents of the area, even <u>unsupervised children used this dangerous path</u> for going to school.</p>

            <h5>Accidents & Fatalities</h5>
            <p>Over time this place deteriorated until reaching a point where it was too dangerous to walk it; after the deaths occurred by reckless adventurers it was closed and the entry banned in 1999 under penalty of a fine for those who were caught using it, they blowed both entrances to this walkway but it still did not prevent of adrenaline lovers to bypass the restriction.</p>
            <p>Numerous accidents have occurred in the Caminito del Rey throughout its existence because landslides and no maintenance at all after it was stopped being used by villagers and workers. Two of the many deaths are the most known because the media:</p>
            <p>- A 12 years old girl who was walking it with an organized tour of children from La Rinconada (Seville) rushed through one of the holes in the pavement a Friday in 1993. I could hear from first hand the accident from a school friend of that girl who was there and saw her fall hopelessly.</p>
            <p>- On Friday 12 August in 2000 a group of 4 friends were in the early morning at somewhere near the middle of the path with the idea of using and old and rusty iron cord connecting the bridge area with the train tunnel as a zip line (an activity which was popular among the visitors of the area despite the risk). The journey through that zip line stopped always in the middle, from there the person using it had to finish the zip-trip using their arms. That time 3 of those friends dared to use the cord at the same time with the bad luck the weight caused the side next to the rail to brake and give in. One of them did not dare to use the zip-line as he had vertigo, so was able to look for help in a near village; unfortunately it was late as the fall caused instant death to the three of them.</p>
            <p>Anyone curious about this activity can still find videos about that zip line being used shortly before the accident.</p>
