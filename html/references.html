                <p>Dubbed “one of the world’s scariest hikes”, the walkway attached to the steep walls of the El Chorro gorge in the province of Málaga, southern Spain, reopens to the public on 28 March after a €2.7m refurbishment. Built at the turn of the 20th century to give workers access to two hydroelectric plants, the path – also known’s as the King’s Little Pathway – was closed in 2000, for more than a decade, after a number of people died attempting to cross it.</p>
